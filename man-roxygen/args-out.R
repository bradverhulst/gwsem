#' @param out a file name or pathway where the output from the analysis will be saved. 
#'        The default pathway is "out.log", which will save the file in the working 
#'        directory. Users should take caution when specifying the output file name so 
#'        that the output from different analyses/chromosomes do not overwrite existing files.
