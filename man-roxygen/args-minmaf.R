#' @param minMAF The minimum valid minor allele frequency (MAF). Large differences between the variances of two variables in the same model can cause optimization failures that invalidate the model. Further, very small minor allele frequencies are more affected by outliers or influential observations. Accordingly, users can specify the minimum allowable MAF. The default value is MAF > .01. Users may also wish to filter out small MAF alleles from their genotype files in other software programs, such as PLINK.
